  abstract: <p>Ridhwana Khan, co-founded Kasi Maths in response to something she noticed; South Africa's education system doesn't set learners up well to access and thrive in tech and STEM-related careers. This is especially true for learners from underserved communities who don't have much exposure to tech and experience language barriers in learning. This is why Ridhwana believes skilled professionals/developers have the ability and responsibility to help where they can.</p>
