  abstract: <p>We’ve always put a lot of effort into performance at DEV (https://dev.to/). We want our users to be able to see their content almost instantaneously when interacting with our site. In order to do so we’ve placed emphasis on caching. We’ve had to ask ourselves questions like what are the right things to cache? Which layer in the stack would be best to cache it? And how will this affect the overall performance?</p> <p>During this presentation, I’d like to show you some of the caching strategies we have in place and discuss how they’ve sped up the interactions within our site.</p>

  location: Johannesburg, South Africa
  abstract: <p>Digital skills and STEM aren’t widely taught in South African schools and, while the government knows this is a problem, they are still working on a solution. We as individuals, organisations and communities in the tech space have the abilities to get involved, and gradually and sustainably improve the lives of students in our country. In this talk, Ridhwana will share her experiences running a non-profit organisation in the education sector, and how she’s built a curriculum for teaching STEM.</p>

  abstract: <p>I started my career in corporate, co-founded a company, moved to freelancing and now work in a startup, whilst running an NPO. As my journey continued, I began to realise that the success of the products that I worked on, as well as my professional fulfilment were influenced by the dynamics of the teams I work with. There are many factors that help teams to be effective, conducive to growth and perform better overall. During this talk I’d like to explore some of these elements.</p>

  abstract: <p>Moving towards consulting in the recent dates has provided me with the opportunity to integrate within different clients environments and teams, thus exposing me to the unique set of learnings and challenges that come with each environment.</p> <p>I’ve found that adapting, but not necessarily conforming has been essential. Challenging the norms, being curious and always learning has been key tools in my toolkit over the dates.</p> <p>I’d like to spend some time unpacking my tools to show you how I’ve used them to twist, turns and fasten the bolts of my journey in order to create a steady and stable structure that has allowed me to grow and thrive within the development community.</p>

  abstract: <p>As humans we are placed in complex environments, where we are required to provide solutions to the problems that we encounter on a daily basis. This can be within your career, your personal life, or your business, and we know that many times solving the problem isn’t as easy as we’d like or hoped it to be.</p><p>During this talk, I’d like to walk the audience through problem solving techniques that I use on a daily basis whilst building software that impacts peoples lives. I’d like to use this opportunity to discuss some of the more complex problems that I’ve had to solve over the past date, and focus on the process to obtaining valuable solutions..</p>

  tags: javascript
  location: Johannesburg, South Africa
  abstract: <p>According to Github statistics, Javascript is the most used language today.</p> <p> As new Javascript frameworks and libraries are released, teams are utilizing them across all levels of the stack - the frontend, backend, desktop apps, hybrid apps, embedded devices and so much more.</p><p> There are many developers that are using Javascript every day, all day - however, many of us haven’t really delved deep into understanding the internals. Newer frameworks have made it such that developers can build full applications without ever learning about things like the javascript engine, callback queues, runtime, call stacks, concurrency, event loops, and the V8 engine. Understanding the nuts and bolts of javascript is no longer a requirement to be able to build applications, however, knowing the details assist developers to be able to build better, cleaner and optimized applications.</p><p>During this talk, I’d like to provide you with fresh insights on how Javascript works under the hood!</p>

  abstract: <p>We are moving towards an era where API’s are now forming the crux of communication between different applications.</p><p>Hence, we need to ensure that our API's follow a good design and architecture, so that integration between different applications can be accomplished with minimal complexity and maximum efficiency.</p><p>In this talk, I would like to explore the JSON API spec, benefits and disadvantages of micro services, Rails 5 for your JSON API's, and the tools and workflow that, we as developers, can use to minimise delays when working in big teams, asynchronously, on the frontend and API.</p>

- title: Journey through the eyes of a newbie female developer
  conference: Pycon ZA
  date: 2010
  media: https://youtu.be/vKJzuEDiSNM
  slides: https://www.slideshare.net/RidhwanaKhan/journey-throughtheeyesofanewbiefemaledeveloper
  tags: pycon
  location: Johannesburg, South Africa
  abstract: <p>Graduating from a 90% male computer science class, to an initially 100% male software development team, finally allowed me to realise that there is a dire lack of women in the computer science field.</p><p>Entering this industry in a minority invokes initial feelings of the need to constantly prove oneself and one's capabilities – normally this puts one at an immediate disadvantage. However, given the correct circumstances, surrounding environments and attitudes, these adverse feelings can quickly be replaced with self-confidence. I was fortunate enough in my daily working environment to have my opinion given the weight that it deserved.</p><p>However, experience has also taught me that the sailing is not always so smooth within every aspect of the development field. Certain environments are a lot less welcoming to women because of the strange misconception that they are going against the norms of society.</p><p>As a newbie, within the development industry, one has to be able to adapt and have an open mind to gain unbounded knowledge and learning experiences. The world of development is a polyglot environment and striving to build an ambitious career involves lots of hard work and dedication.</p><p>I would like to take the audience on a journey to experience the obstacles, growth and challenges that I’ve faced. I also aim to provide concrete suggestions on increasing female willingness to join the tech industry, and improving co-existence in the development environment.As a developer, my goal is to provide inspiration to capable young women, to fathers who have daughters, brothers who have sisters, and men who have female colleagues.</p>
