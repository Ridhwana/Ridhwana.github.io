        I bring over a decade of experience in software development to the table 👩🏽‍💻.
        I am driven by the satisfaction of building systems that make a positive
        impact on people's lives and the ability to create something meaningful
        out of nothing.

      <p class="home__description-content-paragraph">
        I enjoy sharing knowledge through mentoring 👥, speaking at conferences 🎤, and
        writing ✍🏼. I am a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion
        in tech and have been involved in various initiatives to promote these
        values. I am passionate about building inclusive communities and creating
        opportunities for others to grow and thrive.

      <p class="home__description-content-paragraph">
        My journey as a lead engineer is characterized by a balanced mix of
        technical expertise, leadership skills, and a genuine enthusiasm for
        continuous learning 📚.

        I love talking cats! I have two furry babies, Zeus and Zoey 😻, whom I
        absolutely adore. I am an avid reader and will pick up any book that
        catches my eye 📖. There's a ton of stuff that I love doing in my free time.
        I love baking 🧁, especially trying new cake and dessert recipes. I completed
        the couch to 5K program which was a huge personal achievement for me and
        over time I've developed a love for running 🏃🏽‍♀️. I love to travel ✈️, garden 🪴, and
        spend time with my family and friends 🏡. I also dabble in some sewing
        sometimes 🪡, I've sewed clothes for my cats, skirts and some dresses.
